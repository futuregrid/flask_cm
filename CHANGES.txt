CHANGES
=======


a) introduced a "cloud:" attribute in yaml so its easier to manage and
extract the clouds without checking the type

b) worked on a nasty bug in the refresh method of openstack, and it
now refreshes even after you deleted all vms.

c) changed the logic for the credentials and in addition to the clod:
we have also a credentials: under each cloud

d) added a new parameter to the get function in cm_config that if set
to expand=True it will replace the $ vars with those defined in the
os.environ, so this is cool as it allows us to use $ vars now also in
the yaml file
